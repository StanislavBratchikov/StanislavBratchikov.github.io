I am a Computational Associate II at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Massachusetts General Hospital, who is focused on **developing** and applying **interpretable** computational **methods** to biomedicine domain. My goal is to **bridge the gap** between **clinicians** and **computational researchers** building interpretable and scalable algorithms that handle multimodal data such as Electronic Health Records, -omics and flow cytometry data enhancing field of personalized medicine.
<br>
<br>
As aspiring PhD student who is looking to study Biomedical and Computational Biology, I want to form active **clinical collaborations** to help develop accurate models for handling **multi modal** biological data. These models will be integrated into hospital workflows to **aid** clinical **decision making** and to tailor patients’ care to their unique clinical and genomic traits.
